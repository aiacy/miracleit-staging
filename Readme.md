Hello Amiyah, it's Timmy here. I wanted to take a moment to reach out to you and express my gratitude for the support and encouragement you provided me with when I was an active student on Instagram, just starting out in coding. Your words have meant a lot to me, and I've been trying to get in touch with you for some time now.

I'm hopeful that contributing to this repository will finally give me the opportunity to reconnect with you after all these months. I wanted to let you know that I'm actively seeking remote job opportunities, so if you have any available, I would greatly appreciate your consideration. I genuinely hope you're doing well and feeling fantastic.

I also wanted to check in on you and let you know how much I've grown since our last conversation. Remember when you kindly helped me with my freecodecamp challenge? Well, today, I'm contributing joyfully to your mentor's repository. I hope that makes you proud.

Thank you, Amiyah. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you soon. Feel free to provide any feedback on this readme file, and I truly hope I did a great job with the JavaScript implementation. It was quite challenging, but I thoroughly enjoyed the process, and here we are!

I understand that this repository may not be open for contributions, but I saw this as an opportunity to reach out to you. I genuinely hope it works out well. If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to reach me at oluwatimilehinsamson@gmail.com or via WhatsApp at +2349034894501. Thank you, and I'm eagerly anticipating your response.
